            <p>We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.

            <p>Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. What the devil. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Just use the old one inch brush. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>

Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.
